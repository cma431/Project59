        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>My opinion is that cooking is the best hobby to have, because it can be very useful in life. Cooking is my hobby and has been for several years. I was about five years old, when I started learning how to cook. Cooking is something that I inherited from my grandmother; my grandmother was a professional chef and owned her own restaurant, where I learned how to cook.
            There are so many reasons I love to cook, cooking is one of those things that just comes naturally for me, and I think I inherited, because I can cook almost anything and nail it on the first try, much like my grandmother. But the main reason I love to cook is because it keeps me stress free. For example when I am cooking I have very little time to think, because the cooking is challenging my mind and taking my mind off the stress of everyday life.</p>
